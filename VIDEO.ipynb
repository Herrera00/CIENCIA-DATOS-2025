(0:17) From employees who sell their time to businesses who sell products or services, all economic (0:22) participants sell something and that's what the GDP measures.\n",
        "(0:26) It basically adds up the value of all final goods and services which have been produced (0:31) within a country's borders over a certain period of time. (0:34) The government taxes all of these economic participants and the money it makes each year (0:39) isn't the entire GDP, but rather a percentage of the GDP. (0:44) The money your government makes each year is called government revenue, but since far (0:49) more people talk about the GDP when assessing how well a country did, it should come as (0:54) no surprise that the average individual tends to confuse these two terms.\n",
        "(0:58) What you need to remember is this, government revenue is what the government makes, whereas (1:04) the GDP is what everyone within a country's borders makes combined. (1:09) So, unless government officials become crazy and increase taxes to 100%, the GDP will always (1:17) be greater than the government revenue.\n",
